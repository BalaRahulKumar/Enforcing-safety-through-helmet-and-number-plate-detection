# Enforcing-safety-through-helmet-and-number-plate-detection
The increasing concern for road safety and the enforcement of traffic regulations 
necessitates the development of automated systems to monitor compliance. This 
project proposes an Automated Helmet and Number Plate Detection System for 
Vehicles, aimed at enhancing safety measures and ensuring adherence to traffic 
laws. 
 
The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect both helmets worn by 
riders and number plates of vehicles. Through the integration of deep learning 
algorithms, the system can accurately identify and classify helmets and number 
plates in real-time, even under varying environmental conditions and angles. 
Ensuring road safety is a paramount concern globally. This project proposes a 
robust solution utilizing You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm for real-time 
detection of helmets worn by riders and number plates of vehicles. The YOLO 
algorithm, known for its efficiency and accuracy in object detection tasks, is 
implemented to detect these critical elements on roads. The system utilizes deep 
learning techniques to accurately identify helmets worn by riders and extract 
vehicle number plates from images or video streams. By integrating YOLO with 
image processing and computer vision techniques, the proposed system offers a 
comprehensive solution for enforcing safety regulations and monitoring traffic 
violations. The project aims to contribute to reducing road accidents and 
enhancing law enforcement efforts, thereby promoting safer road environments 
for all stakeholders.
